laser_lines: line detection in laser data as reference frame for ROS
====================================================================

This package contains two nodes. The laser_lines node takes a laser scan as
input and detects lines within that data. This can be used, for example, to
align in parallel to an object like furniture in the environment. The
landmark_frame node uses this data to calculate and publish a reference frame
with respect to a-priori known landmarks based on laser line intersection.

Requirements
------------
The package builds on only basic ROS packages and PCL. It has been
tested on ROS Fuerte (still used on the Freiburg PR2) and PCL 1.7.

Documentation
-------------
The example launch file and landmark configuration contain the parameter
documentation.
